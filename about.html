        <h1>About Bitcoin</h1>
        <h3>Bitcoin Basics</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer virtual currency. This means that in order for a transaction to occur, no middle men or
        central authority is needed. You can send any amount of bitcoins to anyone living anywhere in the world, completely
        eliminating the need for traditional third parties like banks or money transmitters. The cryptocurrency also allows the
        bypassing of capital and AML restrictions.
        
        In order to send or receive bitcoins, all you need to have is a bitcoin address and internet access. You only need to
        be online long enough for the transaction to process. Similarly to traditional bank accounts, you can receive bitcoins
        to your bitcoin address even if you’re offline. When you want to ‘’collect’’ your coins however, you’ll have to find an
        internet connection.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>What's so special about Bitcoin?</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a new and unique financial vehicle, unlike anything the world has ever seen. It’s
        called a cryptocurrency because it uses cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money. Despite the name,
        there is no physical coin to speak of, Bitcoin is a completely electronic form of money.
        
        Bitcoin solves the so called ‘’double spending problem’’ present with digital goods. For example, if I have an mp3 file
        or an ebook on my computer, I can freely copy that file a thousand times and send it to a thousand different people.
        For a digital currency, the possibility for unlimited copying would mean a quick hyperinflationary death. Bitcoin
        solves this by maintaining a peer to peer network and recording each transaction in a public ledger called the block
        chain. Say I send 1 bitcoin from my bitcoin address to my friend John. The bitcoin network records that transaction in
        the block chain and I no longer have possession of that bitcoin. The coin ‘’moved’’ from my bitcoin wallet to John’s
        wallet</p>
        <br/>
