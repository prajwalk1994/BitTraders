        <h1>Product Update – September 17, 2018</h1>
        <p>As per BitTraders’s stance on forks, we believe that our users should benefit from the events like forks and airdrop. Prior
        to supporting and providing the benefits of such events like forks/airdrop or a new asset, we need to ensure safety and
        handle security vulnerabilities of digital assets at BitTraders.
        
        Having said that, BitTraders is pleased to announce that we support Everipedia IQ token airdrop. The airdrop will be based
        on the genesis snapshot as mentioned by Everipedia.
        
        Everipedia (IQ) tokens will be credited based on the EOS wallet balance in BitTraders exchange as on June 2nd 21:59:59 UTC
        (EOS mainnet snapshot). We will share more details on the distribution of IQ tokens soon.
        
        Starting with Everipedia IQ token, BitTraders intends to support more EOS tokens on BitTraders exchange. More details out soon.</p>
